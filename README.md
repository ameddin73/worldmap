# worldmap
Webapp for bikeshare world map.

Part personal project, part gift for my dad. He manages a list of bikeshare programs across the world in a Google Sheets doc. This app hosted on AWS, will update an AWS RDS regularly to match that Google Sheet. It hosts an interactive map using the Google Maps API to visualize the data.
